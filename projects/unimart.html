An eBay-like online item trading web application.

An user can be either a seller or a buyer.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Users may place item listings with images, descriptions, and the pricing.
    </li>
    <li>
        If users are interested in particular listings, they may contact the sellers through a built-in messaging system.
    </li>
    <li>
        (An upcoming feature) Users may choose to pay deposits through online payment gateways such as PayPal.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
We wish to restrict the trades for students, in around school areas, to reduce potential risks during face-to-face item tradings. Therefore, we are currently developing an verification system, to ensure that the users are current students.
</p>

<p>Frameworks used: SpringMVC, MyBatis, Angular<br>
Some tools involved: Intellij IDEA, Apache Maven, PostgreSQL
