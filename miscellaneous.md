- Huge fan of [Formula 1Â®](https://www.youtube.com/user/Formula1), as well as other motorsports championships such as the GT series.

- I speak Madarin, Cantonese, and English. I can read Japanese.

- [How to pronounce my name](https://www.name-coach.com/ziyue-yang-6de7fde3-3026-4cd1-acfa-5b7c30cc036e?share_trigger=true): similar to "zee", "you" in English.

- Vim > Emacs, can't deny it eh :D

- You can find a bunch of sky pictures on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/zyang215), most of which are taken in the Beautiful British Columbia.

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) is the key to succeed in math courses, no kidding.

- I've recently started competing on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yangzi33). Hope to get some medals in the future.

- I don't like stats as much as CS, but doesn't *mAcHiNe LeArNiNg* sound way too cool?

- My hobbies include [playing chess](https://www.chess.com/member/yangzi33), snowboarding, and [reading](https://goodreads.com/yangzi33). Please [get in touch](ziyue.yang@mail.utoronto.ca) with me if you're into these too!
